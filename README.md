# markdowner

This is a small script to compile markdown files to PDFs. It uses
pandoc, latex for the compiling process. Prettier is used to format the
markdown file. Also for converting markdown to tex a template file is
used.

That code is not mine! It is included in the release installer binarys
for convenience. For license information and more visit the respective
sites:

- Latex (MikTex): https://github.com/MiKTeX

- Nodejs: https://github.com/nodejs/node
- Prettier: https://github.com/prettier
- Pandoc Template File:

To install, run the intaller script you can find in the Releases.

To run the program after installing, just open a new terminal and type
"markdowner". This should print some instructions on usage.
